When entering 1:

I/P : 3
O/P : The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in a September 17, 1950 article published in The Miami Herald (Associated Press)

I/P : 5
O/P :  Two years later, Fate magazine published "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door",

I/P : 2

O/P : 
 Subsequent writers did not necessarily follow this definition.
 Some writers gave different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from 1,300,000 to 3,900,000 km2 (500,000 to 1,510,000 sq mi).
 Consequently, the determination of which accidents occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reported them.
 The United States Board on Geographic Names does not recognize the Bermuda Triangle.
